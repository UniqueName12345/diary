<h1>29-04-2025.html</h1>

<p>bruh i just spent <span class="important">1h40m (basically 2 hours)</span> AUTO'ING cloup retribution by Joely Mammoth + co (idk others, don't ask, IDC)</p>

<p>the "survive sex" part??? <span class="important">DISASTER</span>. SUPPOSED to be boss fight with ICON vs low-quality Gnawty image from DKC (???? blame joey NOT ME). instead it was a <em>nightmare from the deepest pits of geometry dash hell</em>.</p>

<p>debugging "survive sex" took longer than i will EVER ADMIT. like bro. bro.</p>

<p>had to hold before "survive sex" starts... had to release after... had to click twice total... HAD TO.</p>

<p>could i auto it? NO. i had to <strong>simulate</strong> auto with <em>player control triggers</em>. PURE SUFFERING. start message says "hold", end message says "let go". easy? NO. annoying? YESSSSSS.</p>

<p>even WITHOUT SS, this level would've been a pain. memory level = cross-checking with youtube showcase = <strong>crying</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>okok but the 80%-85% part??? FAVE. <br>
reasons: 
<ol>
    <li>furry art??? YES PLEASE</li>
    <li>debugging was literally just "slap slope = no death" GOD BLESS</li>
    <li>thought the flower was a male protogen at first glance??? was FLOWEY from undertale??? TOO LATE TO CARE LOL</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>spending <strong>100 minutes</strong> just to get to furry dragon art at the end = totally worth it tbh üêâ</p>

<hr>

<p class="tiny">fun fact (mentioned in the pastebin lol): fave cloup = cloup v2 because of "fat protogen" and "protogen fursuit" in the text. YESSSSSS.</p>
<p class="tiny">fun fact (also in pastebin): discovered "we ride at dawn bitches" meme today. sent me into ORBIT üåï.</p>
<p class="tiny">fun fact (also also in pastebin): using github pages for this diary because FREE = GOOD. i ain't paying for my ramblings.</p>
<p class="tiny">fun fact (relevant finally): first time auto'ing a level longer than 5 seconds lmao</p>

<div class="ad">
    üö® If you like this, you'll LOVE my diary üö®
</div>

<p>also paying $30 for ChatGPT Plus. contemplating LEGAL side hustles to keep feeding my addiction. 4o'ing is life.</p>

<hr>

<p>bonus announcement: üìö I'm also writing a commercial book with ChatGPT's help!!!</p>

<p>it's called <strong>Ethyl's Adventures #1</strong> ‚Äî it's a YA comedy about Ethyl and Johnnie having to take a <em>mandatory survey</em> that turns into complete chaos. it's gonna be on Amazon when it's on Amazon. stay tuned!!</p>

<hr>


<p>anyway imma eat now. mother made lunch. need energy after that BATTLEFIELD of a level. <br>
pls don't expect another auto level. like. ever.</p>

<p>this level ONLY WORKS at 60tps. <span class="important">DEAL WITH IT.</span> i am NOT redoing this hellscape for other tps lol</p>

<h2>IN CONCLUSION: f@%k this level</h2>
